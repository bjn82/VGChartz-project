## Opinions and personal Experiences:
I recently purchased a Sega Genesis. It does not work. Then again, I was always a Nintendo kid. Still, it's amazing to look back at all of the fierce marketing that went on between Sega and Nintendo. It was fierce, and unimaginable in today's state of video game advertising. Seriously.
