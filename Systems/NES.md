## Opinions and Personal Experiences:
My first ever game system was an NES. It was actually my parents. It was very bothersome to get to work, I had to blow on the cartridges to get it to work, and I was bad at playing games. Not to mention, I had weird rituals that I had to do so some games would work. For *The Legend of Zelda II: Adventure of Link*, I had to stand motionless on one foot while the title sequence loaded, otherwise the game would freeze.

As bad as I was at playing, the sense of adventure the games gave me was worth it. I didn't really get frustrated. *The Legend of Zelda* in particular was a great game.

I also remember having a *GamePro* Cheat book list, and had a lot of fun just reading through the book. Several games stuck out to me. In high school, I'd come back and emulate them. *Maniac Mansion* and *Shadowgate* were two in particular.

I also discovered the joy of the warp whistles in *Super Mario Bros. 3*. That is a fantastic game, and I'll always remember the overworld theme for world 1. One of the fun things for me was getting the first two warp whistles and warping to the final world of the game. I was horrible at playing, but it was always fun to try to get as far as I could.

Nowadays, through the virtual console, I've found a new favorite game. *Castlevania*. It's one of my favorite games. It is hard, but without being unfair (for most of the time). It has become one of my favorite series. Both through the music and the gameplay.
