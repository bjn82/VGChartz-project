## Opinions and Personal Experiences:
I bought one from a guy my junior year of high school. It was missing a few cables, but I think that my system currently resides in a good friend's basement.

The worst game I have ever played is on this system. To call it a game is an insult to video games. *E.T.: the Extra Terrestrial*. It was an urban legend that most of the copies were dumped in a desert or something. That fate is not harsh enough.
