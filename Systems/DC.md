* Innovative for its time, it was overshadowed by both the PS2 and the GameCube.
* Sega's final game console.
* Early models of the system didn't have copy protection, so it is possible to burn games onto CD-ROMs and play them. (I'm in the process of doing that).

## Opinions and personal experiences:
I bought one at Bullmoose on a rainy Saturday back in the fall of 2017. I've spent a lot of time trying to get my version to play bootleg games. It really is an interesting system, but I do feel like it was ahead of its time.
