## Opinions and Personal Experience:
We got one during the holiday season of 2012. I had a lot of fun playing *Nintendo Land* with my dad and my sister. Dad and I would switch off who got the game pad and who got the remote for the Zelda game and the Metroid game.

It was a good system, but lacked third party support. Also, the gamepad didn't have a lot of battery life.

My gamepad developed connectivity issues with the system, so we had to get it sent in. We avoided it as long as we could, but it had to happen.
I didn't ever take the system to college with me because my dad actually played it the most. He's put more time into *Hyrule Warriors* than I have. I swear, he's better at it than I am. We'll still play a game or two every now and then.
