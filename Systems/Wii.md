**Other facts:**
* The reason for the odd name was as follows:
 + *"Wii sounds like 'we', which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion."*
* *Wii Sports* was bundled with the console on launch.
* Utilized a wireless remote pointer connected via bluetooth to the system, which had a motion sensor, speaker, could vibrate, and be used in several different positions depending on the game.
* Nintendo got sued because the wrist-straps on the initial remotes kept braking off and damaging the television sets of users.
* Through backwards compatibility and digital download, the system could play a variety of games from the previous generations.
* Though it sold well (remarkably well at launch), it did not do as well as the PS3 or 360 due to the difference in library of games, a lack of key third-party support (due to odd motion controls or lack of power), and the fact that not everyone likes to swing a remote around to play a game.

## Opinions and Personal Experience:
I have had two Wiis. I still own both. The first one we got around launch time somehow. I had a blast playing with it. My dad, my sister, and myself all had a blast playing it. Alas, we were all jamming out to *Rock Band* and the family dog ran past the tv, pulling the cables out and bringing the Wii crashing down from about a 4 foot height to the floor. Miraculously, it still worked... But somehow the cooling system was damaged so the system would overheat in about 40 minutes or so, unless we put an ice pack with a paper towel on top of the system.

The second system was given to me for free by an acquaintance during the summer of 2013 before I started college. I brought the Wii to school with me and left it in my dorm lounge. Nothing was stolen, and people played it a lot. The worst thing that happened was that someone cut the sensor bar.
