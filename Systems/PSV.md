**PlayStation TV:**
Sony released a non-portable variant called the *PlayStation TV*, which lacked a screen, touchpads, microphone, or camera but cost a lot less, utilized either a DualShock 3 or DualShock4 for a controller. (PS3 or PS4 controller). This system for playing portable games did not fare well. (I have one though and do like it).
