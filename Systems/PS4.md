## Opinions and personal Experiences:
December, 2016 I finally got a PS4. When a friend bought a PS4 Pro, I bought his old PS4. I had also purchased several games:
* Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeros
* Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain
* Dark Souls 2: Schollar
* Dark Souls 3
* Bloodborne
* Final Fantasy XV

Unfortunately, my friend didn't sell me a controller because his was busted. After I bought a controller, my family had to drive down to Long Island for a college tour with my sister, so I stayed home due to work. I pulled an all-nighter, beating *Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker* on PS3, and then marathoning the main mission of *Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeros* on PS4 the next day, as well as starting out on *Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain*.

In April of 2017, *Persona 5* came out. That is a fantastic game.

Another funny note: despite wiping the system before selling it to me, evidently my friend was still logged into his Crunchyroll account. So for that whole semester, I got to use his ad-free premium account. The thing that tipped us both off was that shows kept popping up on the watchlist that one of us would add that the other one didn't put on there.
