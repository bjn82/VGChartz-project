## Opinions and Personal Experiences:
My first handheld game system. A cousin of mine got one and I remember I thought it was so cool. I got the polar white color, the same as his. Along with the GBA, I also got *Mario Kart: Super Circuit*. While I had a lot of fun with the game, to this day it remains my least played *Mario Kart* Game.

Somewhere down the line, the left dpad button stopped working, so all I could play was *Super Mario Bros. Deluxe* for the GBC because it was a platformer that all you did was move to the right of the screen. Fortunatley, I got a purple GBA, so I could continue to play.

Many of my most played games of all time are on the GBA.

* Fire Emblem & Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones
* Golden Sun & Golden Sun: The Lost Age
* Pokemon Sapphire
* WarioWare
* WarioLand 4
* Mario & Luigi: SuperStar Saga
* Advance Wars & Advance Wars: Black Hole Rising
* Metroid Fusion & Metroid: Zero Mission
* The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap

Though the internal batteries in my copy of *Fire Emblem* might have died, the memories I have of that game still survive.
