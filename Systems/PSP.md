## Opinions and personal experience:
Like most of Sony's consoles and handhelds, I got this one long after its lifespan. Actually, a friend of mine gave it to me. He actually found it on the side of the road. All it needed was a battery or AC adapter and a bigger memory card. I still take it with me to places. It's a pretty neat system, but due to using mini disc cartridges that spin, I can't play it at work. Though it does have some good downloadable titles.
