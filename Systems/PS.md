## Opinions and personal Experiences:
I owned a PS1 once, and I think it worked.

Most of my memories of the PS1 are from playing its games on other platforms. *Castlevania: Symphony of the Night*, *Metal Gear Solid*, *Silent Hill*, *Resident Evil*, *Final Fantasy* games, and more. *Final Fantasy VII* in particular was a breakthrough game. *Castlevania: Symphony of the Night* also marked the start of a genre known as Metroidvania.

As a fun side note, my PS1 JRPG backlog is sitting at over 300 hours.
