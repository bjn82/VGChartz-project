## Opinions and personal Experiences:
My first Sony console. Early-ish in the PS4's lifespan, I finally purchased a PS3. I did it for a few reasons.
1. *Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance*: couch co-op Castlevania. Sign me up.
2. *Catherine*: An odd, unique storytelling game from Atlas. I'd recommend playing it, but look it up first. It's not for everyone.
3. *Persona*: A good friend of mine recommended I check this series out and I'm so glad I did. While *Persona 3* and *Persona 4* were both originally released for the PS2, they were both available digitally on PSN. Each game took well over 100 hours of my time, and my only regret about those is that I cannot play them for the first time again.
4. *Dark Souls* & *Demon Souls*: I like a challenge.

It's a fun system.
