# PC Gaming

**Competition:**
* Consoles

**Other facts:**
* Consoles used to be much more suited to gaming than PCs, but now its pretty even and in some aspects a PC can outperform consoles. It's all about exclusives.
* Digital retailers of games such as Steam from Valve, Origin from Electronic Arts, uPlay from Ubisoft, GOG from CD Project Red, and others are the publishers for many of the games, but there are also several other self-published games.
* Keyboard & Mouse or a Controller.
* Instead of being made obsolete by the next console generation, parts can be upgraded or swapped out.
* While games consoles can do other things, such as play movies or browse the internet, it is rather difficult to write an essay on your PlayStation or GameCube.

## Opinions and Personal Experiences:
I don't have a PC, I have a mac, so my experience with high-end PC gaming is pretty limited. But I did have a lot of fun playing games like *Half-Life 2* and *Team Fortress 2* after school in high school.

PC Gaming is here to stay, but I personally think it's an arms race.
