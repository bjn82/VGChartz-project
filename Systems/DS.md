## Opinions and Personal Experiences
As with the GBA, two of my three cousins had a silver DS. I got a blue one, and then my dad also got a blue one, and my sister got a red one. Dad and I liked playing *Metroid Prime: Hunters*.

The funny thing is that I broke the same hinge on both mine and my father's DS (the right side one), by dropping it in the same area of my house (the landing), on the same holiday a few years apart (Easter Sunday).

Favorite game on it has to be *The World Ends With You*. Not just as a fantastic game, but it's really influenced both my musical taste, writing style, game tastes and play style. My cousin introduced me to it and I was hooked onto it. It's been rereleased twice since then, and I've purchased it both times. Despite all of the new additions to each of the rereleases, the original holds a certain type of magic that can't really be emulated successfully through either ports or emulation.
