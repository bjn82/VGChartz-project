## Opinions and personal experiences:
I've owned two PS2's, both purchased long after the console's lifespan. They are a handy system. I'm no collector, and I actually tossed my PS1 thanks to it. Granted, it was a dubiously functioning PS1, but still. It has a good library of games, and horror games in particular.
