## Opinions and Personal Experiences:

My parents sold the NES for a GameCube. People criticize that decision to me, but I don't care. I still have my original GameCube, which I've had since launch. It's a good system, and I have of fond memories of playing *Melee* with the neighborhood kids, or playing *Rogue Squadron* with my dad.


Actually, my fondest memories of the GameCube aren't of playing, but of coming home from elementary school during the winter on a Wednesday and watching my dad play *Metroid Prime*. I was terrible at the game, but he was great at it. He was going through the snowy world of Phenandra Drifts, just like the world outside. It's one of those odd memories that I have that stay with me. It's also why *Metroid Prime* is one of my favorite games. The other reason is that it's a fantastic game.
