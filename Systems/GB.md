## Opinions and Personal Experiences
While I never had a Game Boy or a Game Boy Color, I did have several GBC Games. My neighbors had *Pokemon Gold*, which I really wanted to play. A friend of mine is also quite good at speedrunning *Pokemon Blue*.

My favorite games on this system were the *Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons/Ages* games. They featured a linked gameplay system, where once you beat one, you can enter a password for the second game to get items, rings, and a hidden boss. I was always a fan of *Oracle of Seasons* over *Oracle of Ages*.
